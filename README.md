### ðŸ“š What I Learned

Building the *FurBabies Pet Shop* website taught me how to structure and style a responsive, user-friendly site using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I gained hands-on experience with creating reusable layout components, managing image assets, and using icon libraries like Font Awesome to enhance visual appeal. I also learned the importance of accessibility, mobile-first design, and clear content organization. This project helped me better understand how to engage users through design while laying the groundwork for adding interactivity and future e-commerce features. Overall, it was a valuable step in my growth as a front-end developer.
